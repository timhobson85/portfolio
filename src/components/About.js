        <p>As an entrepreneur running a family wedding photography business, I have captured approximately 400 weddings over the course of 15 years. Working with clients and understanding their needs has allowed me to practice creativity, as well as work within cross-functional teams, develop attention to detail, and tackle unique problems.

        As a Junior Software Engineer-in-training, I am looking to combine my artistic and technical sides and still have the ability to provide creative solutions. Ideally, I would love to work within a team that values employee growth, provides mentorship and is working to help others.</p>
